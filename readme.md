This repository is the code required to replicate the figures produced for GRL Paper:

by Quinn Mackay, Yifei Fan, Laifang Li, and Kris Karnauskas

1. Code within the "Index Creation and Data Manipulation" folder is unnecessary, as the output of this is already provided within the zenodo dataset. It's available to show the process of attaining the WH and AMOC indexes, as well as regridding data for proper plotting on globe maps. Route the code in the "Figures" folder to your file directory for these files after downloading from Zenodo.

2. Code within the "Slope and Intercept for Projection" folder is also unnecessary. It is regression calculations for each realization to produce the projection graph, but the computed values are already included within the graph code.
